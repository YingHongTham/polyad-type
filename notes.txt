get-polyad-types.py produces:
-4 tables:
	adj-table-(robust)-<date>-(transpose).csv
	-adj-table has row=pre, col=post types
	-transpose because LibreOffice is having trouble with too many columns
	-robust means we get rid of all synapses of size <= 2
-2 more tables:
	outdegrees-(robust).csv
	-counts number of types of post-synaptic types for each pre
-2 plots of the outdegrees tables
